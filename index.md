    <h1>✨ Welcome to My Reading Reverie 💫</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m <span class="belle-script">𝓑𝓮𝓵𝓵𝓮 ❀</span> and welcome to my cozy little corner of the internet!<br>
    I created <strong>My Reading Reverie</strong> because books have always been my safe place, my adventures, and my dreams. This blog is where I’ll collect my bookish thoughts, track my never-ending TBR, and share the stories that either stole my heart or didn’t quite make it 💜</p>

  <h3>Here’s how I’ll be organizing my shelves here:</h3>
  <ul class="home-list">
    <li>📖 <strong>Read</strong> → Books I’ve finished (with my reviews & ratings).</li>
    <li>📚 <strong>TBR (To Be Read)</strong> → My ever-growing pile of books I want to get to.</li>
    <li>🫣 <strong>DNF (Did Not Finish)</strong> → Books I had to set aside for now.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Think of this blog as my reading journal — a dreamy place where I can keep track of my obsessions and connect with others who love stories just as much as I do ✨</p>

  <p>🌸 Thank you for stopping by — I can’t wait to share this journey with you!</p>
