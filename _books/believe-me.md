*Believe Me* was such a sweet little bridge after the chaos of the main series. It felt like a bonus peek into Juliette and Warner’s world as they tried to settle into normalcy.  

I loved the **soft, intimate moments** — it was nice to see Warner drop his walls a bit and Juliette reflect on how far she’s come. The novella gave closure while still showing that healing takes time.  

It wasn’t as high-stakes as the other books (which is why I gave it 4★ instead of 5), but it was heartwarming and satisfying.

  Personal note: I’ll never say no to more Warner & Juliette scenes 💜
