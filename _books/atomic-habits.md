I tried reading *Atomic Habits* because everyone seems to rave about it, but I quickly realized that **non-fiction just isn’t my thing**.  

It’s well-written and practical, but I couldn’t stay engaged. I much prefer getting lost in fictional worlds rather than reading advice, no matter how helpful it might be.  

So this one is going to the **DNF shelf** — maybe one day I’ll return to it if I ever feel like I need a push in productivity.

  Personal note: I’d rather read about faeries and found families than habit loops 💜
