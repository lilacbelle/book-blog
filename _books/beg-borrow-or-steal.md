summary: Emily Walker hates having her carefully crafted world disrupted by anyone, most of all her legendary nemesis, Jack Bennett. He's the opposite of the wonderful heroes she dreams up in her double life as a romance writer, which is why Emily was perfectly happy when Jack left Rome, Kentucky, mid-school year, with his fiancée. The last thing Emily saw coming was Jack’s return at the start of the summer after calling off the wedding and ending his relationship, but he’s here to stay—as her colleague and her neighbor.

This book was *everything* I wanted from Sarah Adams 💜 The banter was so sharp and fun, the emotional beats hit just right, and the small-town vibes made it cozy and addictive.  

The romance was equal parts sweet and swoony. I laughed, I melted, and I didn’t want it to end. Sarah’s books always feel like a warm hug, and this one definitely became a new comfort read for me.

  Personal note: I’d beg, borrow, or steal just to read this book again ✨
