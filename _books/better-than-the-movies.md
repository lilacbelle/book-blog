This book had me smiling the *entire* time 💕. It was funny, heartfelt, and gave me all the rom-com vibes I could ever want.  

Liz was so relatable in her hopelessly romantic, sometimes over-the-top way, and Wes? Total book boyfriend material. Their banter was perfection, and watching the “fake dating” plan slowly turn into something real was everything.  

It also had emotional depth with Liz processing her mom’s absence, which balanced out the humor so well. By the end, I was grinning and swooning — and honestly wishing I could re-read it immediately.  

<div class="note">
  Personal note: Wes and Liz’s banter deserves its own movie 🎬💜
