I went into *A Tempest of Tea* so excited — the premise of a heist crew + vampires + a deadly tearoom setting sounded amazing.  

But honestly, I just **wasn’t vibing with it at the time**. The pacing felt slow for me, and at over 450 pages, I didn’t have the patience to stick with it.  

This one’s going to the **DNF shelf** for now. Maybe I’ll give it another try when I’m more in the mood for a gothic-style fantasy.

  Personal note: Sometimes even a cool heist + vampires combo can’t fight a reading slump 💔

🤔 **Recommend?**  
✅ *Yes, if you like*: atmospheric gothic fantasy, tea-house intrigue, slow-burn heists, and morally grey crews.  
❌ *Skip/Not now if you dislike*: slower pacing, heavier YA fantasy tropes, or long setups before action.
