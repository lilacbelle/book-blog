This book *hooked me right away*. I loved the mix of **fairy-tale retelling** and dark fantasy. Feyre’s journey from a struggling mortal to someone who dares to stand up against impossible odds had me rooting for her the entire time.  

The romance with Tamlin had that classic “forbidden love” energy, and even though things were complicated, I was invested. The **trials Under the Mountain** were brutal but kept me on edge. And of course… Rhysand’s first real appearance 👀 — I knew there was more to come.  

As a start to the series, it’s magical, tense, and addictive. I devoured it.

  Personal note: I should’ve known the story really starts when Rhysand walks in 💜
