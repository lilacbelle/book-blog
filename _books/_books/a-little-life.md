I picked up *A Little Life* knowing it was going to be heavy and emotional, but honestly… the **length** and the **intensity** of the writing just weren’t clicking for me at the time.  

It’s beautifully written, but I wasn’t in the right headspace for something this long and emotionally draining. So, for now, this one is going to my **DNF shelf** — maybe someday I’ll revisit it when I’m ready for a heart-wrenching read.  

<div class="note">
  Personal note: This book already felt like carrying a weight — I needed something lighter 💔

>  
> “He had looked at Jude, and he had thought, *You are the one.*”

🤔 **Recommend?**  
✅ *Yes, if you like*: long, deeply emotional literary fiction that explores trauma and friendship in painful detail.  
❌ *Skip/Not now if you dislike*: very long books, heavy trauma themes, or emotionally exhausting reads.
