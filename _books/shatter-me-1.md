📚 **Summary (non-spoiler)**  
Juliette has a lethal touch — one skin-to-skin contact and she can kill. Locked away by The Reestablishment, she feels broken, dangerous, and completely alone… until she discovers that her gift might be the key to bringing down the corrupt system controlling their world. Along the way, she’s forced to question who she can trust — and who she can’t.

💭 **My Thoughts**  
*Shatter Me* pulled me into Juliette’s world right away. The writing is unique, lyrical, and full of crossed-out thoughts that make you feel like you’re inside her head. I loved how intense and emotional it was — sometimes dramatic, sometimes poetic, but always gripping.  

Juliette is such an interesting narrator: fragile yet strong, and her voice feels so raw. Warner instantly caught my attention (you can already tell he’s going to be more than “just the villain”), and Adam… well, the tension was real! The pacing was fast, and it left me needing the next book immediately.  

This book was a mix of angst, romance, and rebellion — exactly what I wanted.

✨ **Favorite Quotes**  
> "Raindrops are my only reminder that clouds have a heartbeat."  
>  
> “I spent my life folded between the pages of books. In the absence of human relationships I formed bonds with paper characters. I lived love and loss through stories threaded in history; I experienced adolescence by association. My world is one interwoven web of words, stringing limb to limb, bone to sinew, thoughts and images all together. I am a being comprised of letters, a character created by sentences, a figment of imagination formed through fiction.”  
>  
> “All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”  
>  
> “I've been screaming for years and no one has ever heard me.”  
>  
> “Hope is hugging me, holding me in its arms, wiping away my tears and telling me that today and tomorrow and two days from now I will be just fine and I'm so delirious I actually dare to believe it.”
