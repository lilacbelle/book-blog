This book *destroyed me in the best way*. It takes everything from ACOTAR and makes it deeper—more character growth, more feelings, more stakes.  

Feyre’s **healing arc** is raw and beautiful; watching her claw her way back to herself in the Night Court felt cathartic. **Rhysand**? Supportive, patient, and swoony—he doesn’t cage her, he champions her. And the **Inner Circle** (Cassian, Azriel, Mor, Amren) gave me pure found-family serotonin.  

It’s long, yes, but I savored every page. The banter, the slow-burn tension, the reveals… and that ending left me feral in the best way.

<div class="note">
  Personal note: Rhysand set the bar WAY too high 💜

✨ **Favorite Quotes**  
> “To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”  
>  
> “He thinks he'll be remembered as the villain in the story. But I forgot to tell him that the villain is usually the person who locks up the maiden and throws away the key. He was the one who let me out.”  
>  
> “I fell in love with you, smartass, because you were one of us—because you weren’t afraid of me, and you decided to end your spectacular victory by throwing that piece of bone at Amarantha like a javelin. I felt Cassian’s spirit beside me in that moment, and could have sworn I heard him say, ‘If you don’t marry her, you stupid prick, I will.”  
>  
> “There are good days and hard days for me—even now. Don’t let the hard days win.”

🤔 **Recommend?**  
✅ *Yes, if you like*: epic fantasy romance, found family, slow-burn healing arcs, and immaculate banter.  
❌ *Skip if you dislike*: longer books with heavy emotional recovery and politics alongside romance.
