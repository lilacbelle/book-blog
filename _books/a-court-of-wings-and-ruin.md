I picked this up after *A Court of Mist and Fury* and honestly… I just wasn’t in the mood.  

The book is **very long** and felt heavier on politics and war strategy than I was ready for at the time. I know there’s payoff and epic battles ahead, but I couldn’t push myself through it.  

So for now, this one goes to the **DNF pile** — maybe I’ll return when I’m craving a big, war-driven fantasy.

🤔 **Recommend?**  
✅ *Yes, if you like*: epic fantasy wars, fae politics, and high-stakes battles.  
❌ *Skip/Not now if you dislike*: long books with heavy politics and slower pacing.
