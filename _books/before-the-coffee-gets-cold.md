I really wanted to love this one because the **premise sounded so unique and cozy** — a café where you can travel back in time until your coffee gets cold.  

But the pacing was slow and the writing style didn’t click with me. It’s short, but it still felt like a drag, and I just couldn’t bring myself to finish.  

So this one ended up in my **DNF pile** — maybe I’ll revisit it when I’m in the mood for something quieter and more reflective.

  Personal note: I loved the idea more than the execution 💔
