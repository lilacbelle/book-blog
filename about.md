Hi, I’m <span class="belle-script">𝓑𝓮𝓵𝓵𝓮 ❀</span> — the girl behind <em>My Reading Reverie</em>.  

<blockquote>“Lost in stories, found in reverie.”</blockquote>

Ever since I was little, books have been my safe place, my adventures, and my dreams. I’ve lived a thousand lives through pages — fallen in love with characters, wandered through magical worlds, and sometimes cried over stories that stayed with me long after I closed the book.  

This blog is my cozy corner of the internet where I share:  

- 📖 **The books I loved & finished**  
- 📚 **My never-ending TBR list**  
- 💭 **The books I couldn’t quite finish (DNF)**  
- ✨ **Random bookish thoughts, quotes, and little obsessions**  

I believe every book leaves a mark — whether it’s a whole story I devoured in a day, or just a single line that stuck with me forever.  

So welcome to my reading reverie 💜 — a dreamy little space where I document my love for stories, one page at a time.  

🌸 Stay cozy,
