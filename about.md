Hi, Iâ€™m Belle ðŸŒ¸  

Iâ€™m completely obsessed with books â€” fantasy, romance, and everything in between.  
This blog is where I keep track of my reading journey: the books Iâ€™ve loved, the ones I want to read, and the ones I couldnâ€™t finish.  

Youâ€™ll find summaries, favorite quotes, ratings, and my honest thoughts on every book I pick up.
